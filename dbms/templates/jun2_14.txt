This article is about my life you when I moved from second year to third year.
During the summer break between the transition I got a chance to do a intern at the one of the company which I have applied online during my 4th semester. I was desperately searching for a company which will provide me some job no matter what it is related to I just wanna do it. 
I have applied for some five or six places . At some there are meager chances of selection as I don't have sky scraping GPA nor I have done a research project. 
So I have applied for few start ups and I got selected in one of them . I have been called for interview and I was so exited to join it. I had done my research on company it seemed to me like a small one but there are great prospects of learning in small firms. I was called for interview before selection and I have performed fairly. 
The things were asked mostly related to my commitment towards work. I responded to every question by saying that I will 110% to it....This way I got selected.
As my exams got over on 5th May . I moved to my brother's place and as I reached there on 6th morning. It was Tuesday as it is supposedly to be a working day. Everybody were rushing to their work. But I was sleeping without any tension. Everybody went out I was still sleeping at my bed It was 12 I received a call from my manager. He called me to know whether I am coming or not. I told him I'll be there by 2 pm .
I somehow managed to reach there by time. It was so difficult to catch a bus in Bangalore as stops on the bus are written in Kannada and there was a Number which identifies it. I searched on Google Maps how to reach there and I got on the right bus . 
The bus dropped me at some stop after walking for one and half kms. I reached there...
I thought the first day is going to be a off for me. But it turns out that I had to sit
